# Auxilium Complete Setup Guide

Quick guide to get both backend and frontend running in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd auxilium_planner
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create `.env` file:
```bash
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
```

5. Start the backend:
```bash
python main.py
```

Backend will be running at http://localhost:8000

## Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to frontend:
```bash
cd auxilium-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env.local` file:
```bash
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1" > .env.local
```

4. Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be running at http://localhost:3000
